# HOW TO USE
**- My Instagram phishing page is really easy to use, you only have to replace WEBHOOK on line `101` by your Discord webhook :**

**- Next you upload it in your website (like netlify or 000webhost, they are free)**<br>
**- When someone will login you will receive his credentials and he will be redirected to a funny video on Instagram for example.**<br/>
**- You can edit the redirection link by editing it on line 108 in the js part in HTML code.**
**- You can also change the redirection link in the line `108`. 
**- Just replace redirection `https://intagram.com` link with your own link **
